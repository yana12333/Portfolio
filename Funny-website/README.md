# Funny Website 😁

## Description
This is a playful interactive website designed for entertainment and creativity.  
The user experience is full of surprises, animations, and clickable elements that react to user actions.

## Features
- **Central message**: Guides the user to click the “correct” button  
- **Interactive GIF**: Clicking it opens a funny video  
- **Moving buttons**: Some buttons "run away" from the cursor  
- **Hidden correct button**: Embedded as a link in the text; clicking it opens a new page with a congratulatory message and a dancing GIF  
- **Relaxation link**: A highlighted word at the bottom opens a “My Little Pony” cartoon for the user to relax

## Technologies
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- GIFs and online media  
- CSS animations for moving buttons  
- DOM manipulation for interactivity

## How It Works
1. The user sees the main page with a message in the center and a clickable GIF  
2. Some buttons move away from the cursor after a click to indicate an incorrect choice.
3. The hidden link inside the text leads to a new page with a funny GIF and congratulatory message.
4. The “here” word at the bottom opens a cartoon video
