# SpongeBob Animation App (Android)

## Description
This Android application demonstrates simple animations using images.  
When the app launches, SpongeBob rises from the bottom of the screen, followed by several animated elements:

- Jellyfish floats and stays on the screen  
- Three bubbles rise upwards and disappear off-screen after a few seconds  

This project was created to practice **Android animations**, image handling, and **UI timing in Jetpack Compose**.

## Features
- Animated SpongeBob entering the screen  
- Animated jellyfish that stays visible  
- Three animated bubbles rising off the screen  
- Smooth motion and timing controlled programmatically  
- Demonstrates basic animation principles in Android  

---

## Technologies
- Kotlin  
- Android SDK  
- Jetpack Compose
- State Management and Animation APIs  

---

## How It Works
1. On launch, SpongeBob image slides up from the bottom of the screen  
2. After a short delay, jellyfish appears and stays on screen  
3. Three bubble images rise upwards and disappear beyond the top of the screen  
4. All animations are coordinated using timing functions and state management (`mutableStateOf`)

---

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to:  
- Learn how to create animations in Android using images  
- Control multiple animations simultaneously  
- Understand state management in UI animations  
- Practice visually appealing motion effects for interactive apps

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the project in Android Studio  
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device
