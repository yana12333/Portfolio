# 15-Puzzle Solver 🧩

## Description
This project is a program that solves the classic 15-puzzle problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.  
The application was developed as a coursework project focused on algorithmic problem-solving techniques.

While the current implementation uses only BFS, the coursework included a theoretical analysis of multiple search algorithms (BFS, DFS, and A*).  
In the future, this project will evolve into a bachelor's thesis, where additional algorithms will be implemented and experimentally compared in terms of efficiency, performance, and solution quality.

## Features
- Solves the 15-puzzle automatically  
- Implements one search algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
- Displays the solution path  

## Technologies
- Kotlin  
- Search Algorithms  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Jetpack Compose
- State Management
- Android SDK  

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Explores all nodes level by level and guarantees the shortest solution path.

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to study search algorithms, apply them to a real combinatorial problem, and lay the groundwork for further research.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the project in Android Studio  
3. Run the application on an emulator or physical device
